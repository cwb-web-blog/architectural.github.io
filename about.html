                <h3> <i class="fa fa-flag" style="font-size:35px"></i> CORE VALUES </h3>
                <p>Construction's core values have been shaped over more than 10 years of delivering the finest construction services to our clients. 
                    They stood to the test of time and these principles remain our bedrock lynchpins. 
                    We never tried to cut on either quality, the pace of work or any other construction aspect. We stay true to our
                     full promise of efficiency!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-grid-item">
                <h3> <i class="fa fa-rocket" style="font-size:35px"></i> PACE </h3>
                <p>Our love for detailed, bullet-point preparations, as well as to open and clear project management and communication is what makes us
                     faster than the competition. Recently we compared a technically
                     similar 10-stories building that we built, and the other built by our main competitor. Their price and pace was 2 times lower than hours!</p>

                <h3>  <i class="fa fa-trophy" style="font-size:35px"></i> QUALITY </h3>
                <p>Quality is focal in every little aspect of the construction. The mindset of both our senior employees and all the way to our on-site contractors and 
                    construction workers centers on 
                    attention. It's out attention to details that allows us to work on a multitude of projects simultaneously, while staying on schedule!!</p>

                <h3> <i class="fa fa-leaf" style="font-size:35px"></i>  ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS </h3>
                <p>Besides valuing your time, your money and your vision for the project, we also value the Mother Nature as well...
                    It cannot be denied anymore, that even the small construction implements the nature in a bad way... That's why we're leading the effort 
                    to use only eco-friendly materials and comply with keeping the environment unpollluted by the work we do!</p>
